## Arbitration / dispute resolution

### Governing Law. 

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

### Resolution of Any Dispute. 

In the event a dispute arises between you and Magazine Order Center (“Dispute”), we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting us by writing to Strategic Media, LLC, P.O. Box 251-H, Scarsdale, N.Y. 10583. If, however, the Dispute cannot be resolved by the personnel directly involved, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between duly appointed executive officers or other representatives of such parties, with full authority to negotiate and settle the Dispute. If a Dispute has not been resolved by negotiations within 90 days as provided hereinabove, such Dispute shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor (collectively, “JAMS”), for mediation as provided hereinbelow. Any party involved in the Dispute may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and each other party involved in the Dispute a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS’ panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties; provided, however, that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. None of the parties may commence arbitration or a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 30 business days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration or a civil action, if the parties so desire.

### Limitation of Legal Remedies. 

If there is a Dispute that remains unresolved after mediation, **instead of suing in court, you and magazine order center each agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to arbitrate disputes through binding arbitration pursuant to the jams arbitration rules and procedures, on an individual basis, without class relief, except for disputes pertaining to magazine order center’s intellectual property rights and statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable.** This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (“Claim(s)”). The arbitrator’s decision and award are final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

### Jury Trial Waiver. 

**You and magazine order center each voluntarily waive the right to a trial by jury in resolving any dispute between us arising out of these terms or the sites or services.**

### Class Action Waiver. 

**You and magazine order center each agree that claims against the other may only be brought in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding.** All arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person (“Class Action Waiver”).

### Arbitration Procedures. 

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought (“Notice”). All Notices to Magazine Order Center must be sent to the following address: Strategic Media, LLC, P.O. Box 251-H, Scarsdale, N.Y. 10583. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section. Upon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60-day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such 60-day cure period, you or Magazine Order Center may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and Magazine Order Center in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the Dispute. This Section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and Magazine Order Center agree that this Section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA. The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York, and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone. Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com. To the extent that this dispute resolution Section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled “Class Action Waiver”.

### Exception to Arbitration. 

Only disputes or actions pertaining to Strategic Media LLC’s intellectual property rights, or statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable, are exempt from arbitration.

### Survival. 

This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

### Severability. 

If any provision of this Section is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.

## NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there are not third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

## MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms and policies incorporated herein (“Policies”), are the entire agreement between you and Magazine Order Center. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Magazine Order Center relating to your use of the Sites or the Services. Magazine Order Center may assign these Terms in whole or in part, at any time. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. Headings in these Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of these Terms. The failure of Magazine Order Center to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of Magazine Order Center of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by Magazine Order Center or be deemed a waiver by Magazine Order Center of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of Magazine Order Center under these Terms, its Policies and any other applicable agreement between you and Magazine Order Center shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit Magazine Order Center’s right to exercise any other right or remedy.
